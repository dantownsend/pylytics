Version 0.5.1
-------------

- our automated package releasing via Jenkins failed to include some non-Python files in the last release. We can't overwrite an existing release to include those files, hence this new release.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

- pre-run scripts can now be specified, which run before facts
  (see documentation for more information).
